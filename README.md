# tech-tiny-apps
Just created this repo to keep some tech tests

The focus will be on developing web app using and learning
technologies we don't know yet

###List of Ideas: (contribute)


Event CheatSheet Generator
- this app will generate Cheat Sheets for events someone must attend to.
- for example, Birthday party, Best Friend's marriage
- those cheatsheets can be shared, liked (social, stuff)
- it can be private to


TransactionLog

- this app would help one keep track of it's wallet
- the main goal is to show reports monthly and yearly
- should be really easy to use (simpleeee)
- fast to add new transaction

Simple Task Schedule  (but not that simple)

- this one should help with accomplishing tasks
- it should store a task and keep track of it's history
- should give weekly/monthly reports (to help on improving)
- tasks per week, average task completion time


Simple Task Game

- the idea is to do something like http://habitrpg.com
- but with reports on how you're doing 
- the app should give the user cudos (accomplishments, trophies)
- it shouldn't contain the word "game" anywhere (to avoid NSFW problems)
- it's possible to fork the habitrpg game... (needs some thinking over it)

Blind People's WhatsApp
- should do what WhatsApp does (without images and videos for now)
- it should be easy to use (needs research)
- should be 100% voice interface usable
